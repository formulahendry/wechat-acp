# Changelog

## 0.3.0

- Add local message injection via `wechat-acp inject`, backed by a file-based queue under `inject/` and persisted `last-active-user` targeting. This lets local automation enqueue prompts for the running daemon and have replies delivered through WeChat.

## 0.2.5

- Add `-V, --version` CLI flag that prints the version and exits, and include the version in the `--help` banner header. Useful for scripts (`$(wechat-acp --version)`) and for confirming which build is installed.

## 0.2.4

- Add `--hide-diffs` CLI flag and `agent.showDiffs` config option to suppress forwarding ACP file diffs to WeChat. Diffs are still forwarded by default.

## 0.2.3

- Downgrade `applicationinsights` from `^3.0.0` to `^2.9.6`. The v3 SDK is built on OpenTelemetry and explicitly drops support for manually setting User ID and Session ID (see its README's "Limitations" section), which caused the App Insights dashboard to show Users = 1 and Sessions = 1 even after 0.2.2's `tagOverrides` fix. v2 honors `context.tags` and per-event `tagOverrides` as documented, so `user_Id`, `session_Id`, and `application_Version` are now populated correctly. Simplified [src/telemetry/index.ts](src/telemetry/index.ts) to pin static tags once at init and keep per-event `tagOverrides` only for the dynamic session id.

## 0.2.2

- Fix anonymous telemetry so `user_Id`, `session_Id`, and `application_Version` are populated on every event. Application Insights v3 ignores the legacy `context.tags` / `commonProperties` APIs the previous code relied on, which caused the dashboard to always show Users = 1 and Sessions = 1. Each event now carries the install id as `ai.user.id`, a per-WeChat-user (or per-install for lifecycle events) `ai.session.id`, and the package version as `ai.application.ver`.

## 0.2.1

- Save received binary files to disk under `~/.wechat-acp/inbox/` so the agent can read them by absolute path instead of getting only a size notice. Customize with `--inbox-dir <path>` or `storage.inboxDir`; disable with `--no-inbox`. Default location is instance-scoped when `--instance` is used.
- Built-in `copilot` preset now passes `--enable-all-github-mcp-tools` so the agent can use the full GitHub MCP tool surface out of the box.
- Refresh WeChat typing indicator on `tool_call_update` and `plan` events so the indicator no longer lapses during long-running tool calls.

## 0.2.0

- Add `--instance <name>` to run multiple bridges side by side on one machine, each with its own WeChat account, project cwd, daemon pid/log, sync state, and telemetry id. Storage moves under `~/.wechat-acp/instances/<name>/`. Default (no `--instance`) is unchanged.

## 0.1.4

- Update `claude` preset to use `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp` (the deprecated `@zed-industries/claude-code-acp` was renamed)

## 0.1.3

- Forward agent thinking to WeChat by default; use `--hide-thoughts` to opt out (replaces `--show-thoughts`)
- Add anonymous usage telemetry via Azure Application Insights; set `WECHAT_ACP_TELEMETRY=0` to disable
- Hide Windows console windows for daemon and agent child processes

## 0.1.2

- Add `--show-thoughts` flag to forward agent thinking to WeChat (off by default)
- Stream thought messages in real-time at thought→tool and thought→message transitions
- Log all agent thought chunks to terminal for debugging

## 0.1.1

- Set default idle timeout to 1440 minutes (24 hours); use `--idle-timeout 0` for unlimited
- Send typing indicator immediately when prompt is received
- Cancel typing indicator after reply is delivered
- Add GitHub Actions CI workflow

## 0.1.0

- Initial release
- WeChat QR login with terminal QR rendering
- One ACP agent session per WeChat user
- Built-in agent presets: copilot, claude, gemini, qwen, codex, opencode
- Custom raw agent command support
- Auto-allow permission requests from the agent
- Direct message only; group chats ignored
- Background daemon mode with `--daemon`
- Config file support with `--config`
- Session idle timeout and max concurrent user limits
